# Cyber-security 

Elements of Information(protection of info in devices):
1. confidentiality 
2. Integrity 
3. Availability

Elements of Cyber Security(protection of devices):
1. Accountability
2. Authorization
3. Authentication

to check if your gmail is breached visit the website : haveibeenpwned

how can an annonymus person acces your data if the have your mail id & password : 
1. google dashboard - it shows all the records of your mail {history}
2. google timeline - it shows the complete location record {only if location is turned on , a map opens and shows all the records of your travelling}

If your gmail is hacked , then how do can you secure your account: 
1. for every 20 days you need to change your password
2. don't use your scholarship linked accounts for your personal use - create a new account
3. whenever you use a non-guessable password , you need to change - it makes your pw strong , not safe

If you want to check how strong is your password visit the website : howsecureismypassword
if you want to keep your mail safe : 
1. use a temporary mail
2. use temporary mobile numbers visit- tempmobilenumber {only use for testing purposes}

how do you know how many annonymus people are using your aadhar linked mobile numbers - visit tafcop

There are 2 types of challenges in CS :
1. project building
2. Hackathon


OSI model(Open System Interconnection) : reference model for how applications communicate over a network.
- sender : top to bottom
- reciever : bottom to top
  application layer - UI
  presentation layer - how data flows , in what form it flows
  session layer - controls sessions
  transport layer - {TCP/UDP - heart of OSI layer} - transfer of data - data is in the form of datagrams/segments
  network layer - data is in form of frames & packets - decides which path data will take
  datalink layer - defines format of data on network {data is in form of frames}
  physical layer - transmits raw bit stream over physical medium  {data is in 0's & 1's format}
top 3 layers are called as software

TCPIP model
1. application layer - {application ,presentation , session}
2. transport layer - {transport}
3. internet layer - {network}
4. network - {data-link , physical}

GET request - getting data from the server 
POST request - sending data to the server

Network - connection of devices
Networking - communication between the connected devices ( file sharing , internet)
  there are 2 types of network :
1. LAN - local area network
2. WAN - wide area network
3. MAN - metropolitan area network
4. CAN - campus area network
5. PAN - Personal area network

Protocol : A network protocol is an accepted set of rules that govern data communication between different devices in the network.

IP - internet protocol (acts as address on the network & provided by ISP)
2 versions of IP address:
1. IPv4
2. IPv6

HANDSHAKE PROCESS:

3 way handshake:

2 way handshake:

port : physical/virtual point where a particular communication/service starts/ends 
total no. of ports in a network 65,535 ports. there are 3 types :
1. well known port no.s - 1 to 1023
2. registered port no.s - 1024 to 49,151
3. dynamic/temporary/private port no.s - 49152 to 65,535

hacking - unauthorized access. There are 5 phases :
1. information gathering - oen source intelligence - where data of a particular user is accessed
2. scanning - particular open ports are ennumerated and exploited through which access is gained
3. gaining access 
4. maintaining access - 
5. clearing tracks - clearing/deleting the process

ethical hacking - authorized access. there are 6 phases :
{ everything is same as hacking along with another last phase }
6. reporting - checking vulnerabilities and reporting them
